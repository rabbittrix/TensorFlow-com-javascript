Thank you @FestoAG, but bigger please…. I want to get on! #ThinkBig #MARS2019

I’ve written a post about developments with the National Enquirer and its parent company, AMI. You can find it here:

Grateful for the journalists at the @washingtonpost and around the world who do the work, no matter the risk or dangers they face.

I have outstanding news to ring in 2019. Former Alexa VP & long-time Amazonian Mike George has agreed to lead the Day 1 Academies Fund. Mike is a true builder who knows how to start from scratch, and he’ll bring tremendous energy, grit, and passion to the job. Thank you, Mike!

Excited to announce the first annual grants from the Bezos Day 1 Families Fund. $97.5 million to 24 organizations doing needle-moving work on family homelessness. Congrats to the recipients – we know you’ll spend the money wisely and with heart. https://www.bezosdayonefund.org/day1familiesfund…

Had the privilege today of unveiling our newest Amazon Air 767 - "Valor" - named in honor of the thousands of Amazonian veterans and military spouses delivering for our customers every day. #VeteransDay #AmazonWarriors

Yep, that’s me. I was lucky to be exposed to tech and coding at a young age. Inspired a lifelong love of invention. I hope the new Amazon Future Engineer program does the same for some kids today. https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com

Amazon just won The American Foundation for the Blind’s Helen Keller award! Huge kudos to the whole team on working so hard to make our products accessible to the vision impaired! @afb1921

Very sad to hear of Paul Allen’s passing. His passion for invention and pushing forward inspired so many. He was relentless to the end. My heart goes out to Paul’s family and friends.

Thank you to the @usairforce for your confidence in the @BlueOrigin team and our #NewGlenn rocket. We are proud to serve the national security space community and are committed to providing safe, reliable access to space for the nation. #GradatimFerociter
