Elon Musk:
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case & more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.

Jeff Bezos:
Big win for @BlueOrigin today! And a big thank you to @ulalaunch for choosing our BE-4 engine. Excited to be a part of Vulcan’s mission to space. #21stCenturyEngine #AllAmericanEngine #GradatimFerociter
